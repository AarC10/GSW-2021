# this is what packet's coming from the receiver should look like
# if measurements have the same name the latest one's size is used (furthest down in the file)!

# these need to be set at some point
# these are the address and port the receiver will send packets TO on the ground station
# it does not matter what port/addr the receiver sends from as long as multiple receivers have different addresses/ports
# currently address doesn't do anything since the ground station doesn't determine it's ip (only one network card, may have multiple receivers)

# [measurement name] [total measurement size in bytes (including padding)] [most sig padding (bits)] [least sig (bits)] [optional type of int, float, or string, default is int] [optional signed or unsigned, default is signed]
