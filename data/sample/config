# SAMPLE CONFIGURATION
# if measurements have the same name the latest one's size is used (furthest down in the file)!

# specify the protocol for packets to use (must be set at some point)
protocol = udp

# the port the device should send packets FROM (e.g. src port from device is 'port')
# packets from this port will have their address copied and any outgoing packets will
# be sent to that port
# if their are multiple devices, whichever device(s) receive should send packets from this port
port = 8080

# set a multicast address that the receiver will send packets to (ground software should listen on this address)
# optional, if not set will receive at IP address of default interface

# [measurement name] [total measurement size in bytes] [optional type of int, float, or string, default is int] [optional endianness, big or little (default)] [optional signed or unsigned, default is signed]
# endianness and signed/unsigned cannot be specified without a type
# the order of signedness and type do not matter
# endianness is effectively ignored for strings (doesn't make sense)
