DONE - created mkshm script in startup - maybe move mkshm to startup

DONE - ldms/shm - create an access shm lib

DONE - lib/shm -rename lib/loadconfig to something better

DONE add in Makefile to copy .so libraries to lib/bin so they can be easier linked with processes in proc

NOT DOING - no need, just attach each time - create a mkshm tool in proc

DONE make includes easier to manage (move to includes dir instead of next to src)

DONE - install/setenv.sh - make build shell script so bash variables can be set (base directory, for where to put bin, queues, and other temp data)

DONE update documentation on confluence for new mqueue system logging

maybe add a proxy process in 'proc' dir that reads measurements and hosts them on a TCP server as JSON packets (so the front end can grab them)

add signal handlers for SIGKILL for any process using a network / file resouce
    - I think right now this is dlp closing files and decom closing it's socket

maybe add a status shared lib so processes can report their status
    -e.g. decom is up, decom network error, etc.
