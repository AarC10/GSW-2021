add in Makefile to copy .so libraries to lib/bin so they can be easier linked with processes in proc

create a mkshm tool in proc

make includes easier to manage (move to includes dir instead of next to src)

make build shell script so bash variables can be set (base directory, for where to put bin, queues, and other temp data)
